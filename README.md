## 📖 My Story — For the Curious

If you’d like a closer look behind the scenes of my journey

Hello! I’m Ahmed Nobi, a passionate Senior Android Developer currently shaping the future of fintech at Cashi. My journey into mobile development began over five years ago, driven by a simple question: **how can a few lines of code transform daily life for millions?**

From building my first humble app in Upper Egypt to contributing to impactful fintech solutions today, my path has always been guided by a deep respect for clean code, architecture, and user-centered design. I’ve explored many technologies, but Android quickly became my home — a place where I can balance creativity, performance, and scalability.

At Cashi, I’m helping to build secure, reliable, and user-focused financial products for Sudan and beyond. I work daily with **MVVM** and **MVI** architecture patterns, explore **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** for code sharing, and apply **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)** to create modern, consistent user experiences. Working closely with talented cross-functional teams, I help ship products like MyCashi, Cashi Lite, and Cashi Mobile.

Beyond product work, I’ve also contributed as an Android Subject Matter Expert with SureSkills, creating training materials and practical projects to support other developers in mastering Android best practices. That experience deepened my commitment to knowledge sharing and technical excellence.

I’ve also contributed to projects like **MyZesty**, a feature-rich media editing platform, and **ViuLive**, a real-time live streaming application — experiences that taught me how to build for usability, performance, and scalability while collaborating with diverse, talented teams.
